CSCI 494 Final Project
====================

Repository for a class assignment by Kalvyn Lu and Todd Beckman.


Website Strategy
----------------

The purpose of this website is to provide users with a pair of tools to assist
them in their venture into the world of competitive Pokémon battling.

- The first tool is an informative tool linking together the various 
elements of competitive Pokémon. This tool should provide information about
each Pokémon, move, ability, and item. The links between these pages will 
contain many links between each other, so the use of a tool called [Pokéapi](http://pokeapi.co/) will be used to query information to be cached on this
web server.

- The second tool is a team generator. At the minimum, it should be able to
randomly compute a team of six Pokémon.

The target audience of this project is the competitive Pokémon community, 
where many various tools exist to do the tasks this website plans to fulfill.
However, none of these tools can both generate a team and provide the 
information. Smogon comes the closest, with a suite of tools including Pokémon 
Showdown, the most popular Pokémon battle simulator, and an extensive database 
Smogon Dex. Users still must use each of these tools separately even though
teammaking heavily relies on having the database of information easily 
accessible.
